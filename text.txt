Around the world we have a global obsession of superhero comic characters even though they are not real, the billion dollar industry about them. Would you even imagine the franchise we would have to endure if they came into real life! This franchise would become The One quite easily. Here comes this The Boys !

Easily might become the greatest first season of A Superhero TV show ever, competing with Marvels Daredevil ofcourse. But this scrip is so freaking impressive, the over the top violence and gore along with great dialogues and brilliant acting easily brings it to the top. i would be really surprised if the two KIWI lead protagonists, Kurl Urban and Anthony Starr wouldn't get nominated for best actors in a leading role, specially Starr. He was absolutely brilliant as the lead antagonist Homelander. That says something for a superhero movie, wouldn't you say !

Was waiting patiently for this show, and living up to that hype was not easy. Had to binge it at once, it's that addictive. Wow! Before even release, Amazon Prime ordered a second season even though the production cost might have been astronomical I would imagine. They were that confident, this was that good. Watch it, you'll enjoy !!
